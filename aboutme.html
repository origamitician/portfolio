    <p class = "longText">Hi everyone! My name is Micaiah Cape, and I'm currently a Regents Scholar at UH Manoa studying computer science. I've gotten into programming after stumbling upon <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a> and creating games with it, but how I started Scratch is a story for a different time. I eventually took DevLeague's introduction to web development course in the summer of 2019, because I was curious about how real-world programming worked. That's when I got into web development. More recently, I've started to learn backend programming, and am in the process of creating a few full stack web applications, most notably being my <a href="https://pitchkeys.github.io" target="_blank">most recent</a> full-stack web app for my YouTube channel. <b id = "emp">More specifically, I am familiar with <span class = 'sp'>HTML</span>, <span class = 'sp'>CSS</span>, <span class = 'sp'>JavaScript (for frontend)</span>, and know the basics of <span class = 'sp'>Node.js</span>, <span class = 'sp'>Express.js</span>, <span class = 'sp'>MongoDB</span>, and <span class = 'sp'>React.js</span>.</b> I also hope to learn Angular.js as well as SQL.<br><br>Although I enjoy web development a lot, I am looking to expand my skill by learning new languages for software development. As of now, I'm thinking of learning Python and C/C++ in the near future. <br><br>If you've seen my <a href="./projects.html" target="_blank">portfolio</a>, you may be wondering why I have multiple GitHub accounts. The primary purpose of each is explained below. </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 25%;">Account Name</td>
            <td style="width: 75%;">Purpose</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class = "chartLeft"><a href="https://github.com/Origamitician" target="_blank">Origamitician</a></td>
            <td class = "chartRight">Primarily for personal projects. Previously I've had two accounts, <a href="https://github.com/pitchk" target="_blank">pitchk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/easymath" target="_blank">easymath</a>, however decided to migrate all major projects on those accounts to Origamitician for organization purposes. This explains why some of my older projects show that I've forked them from either of those accounts.</td>

        <tr>
            <td class = "chartLeft"><a href="https://github.com/tas4teens" target="_blank">Tas4Teens</a></td>
            <td class = "chartRight">Created exclusively for my Tas4Teens website. I didn't want to use my past two accounts, <a href="https://github.com/pitchk" target="_blank">pitchk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/easymath" target="_blank">easymath</a> because I didn't want my domain to be "easymath.github.io" or "pitchk.github.io" on a site dedicated to raising awareness for substance use.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class = "chartLeft"><a href="https://github.com/pitchkeys" target="_blank">PitchKeys</a></td>
            <td class = "chartRight">Also created exclusively for my PitchKeys website. Although "pitchk.github.io" using <a href="https://github.com/pitchk" target="_blank">pitchk</a> could have worked, I had other (personal) published items in my "pitchk" account, and the last thing i wanted was users unknowingly typing in a URL for any of my published repositories (e.g. they might go to "pitchk.github.io/another-repository" when they are already on "pitchk.github.io." <br><br><b>TL;DR:</b> created to protect personal details.</td>
